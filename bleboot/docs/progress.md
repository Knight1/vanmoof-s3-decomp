# bleboot — decompilation progress

Per-function status for the TI BIM (Boot Image Manager) bootloader of
the BLE radio MCU (CC2642R1F). The OEM image is `bleboot_1.0.0.bin`
— 8 KB, loaded at flash `0x00056000`. The image's last 88 bytes are
CCFG (Customer Configuration), so the executable region is a couple
hundred bytes shorter than 8 KB.

## Summary

```
6 decomp-c / 2 vendor-stock / 2 named / 53 pending
```

(`63` total functions in Ghidra at base `0x00056000`.)

**Toolchain identified**: the OEM image was built with the **TI ARM
Compiler / CCS**, not GCC. Evidence: the `_auto_init_*` descriptor-
table runtime init at `0x56BF0` (50 B walking 8-byte `{type, arg}`
records through a function-pointer dispatch table) is TI CGT's
canonical compiler-runtime pattern — GCC emits inline-asm
.data/.bss copy loops instead. Also confirmed by the
`_system_pre_init` weak hook at `0x571A0` and the BIM project
layout in the TI SDK shipping CCS / IAR variants.

## Per-module log

- **`rts_hooks.c`** — Two TI CCS RTS weak-default hooks the OEM
  image kept unchanged: `_system_pre_init` at `0x000571A0`
  (returns 1 to enable cinit; compiles to `movs r0, #1; bx lr` =
  `2001 4770`) and `_exit` at `0x000571A4` (post-main trap;
  compiles to `nop; b .` = `bf00 e7fe`). Both are byte-equivalent
  to the OEM under the project CFLAGS.
- **`main.c`** — BIM main at `0x00057000`. Reads low 4 bits of
  the MMIO config register at `0x40032430`, caches `(val << 10)`
  in the SRAM global at `0x20000400`, then tail-calls the (still
  undecoded) BIM dispatcher at `0x56F2A`. Returns 0 to the
  startup. Compiles to 24 B at `-Os`, same size as the OEM, but
  **not byte-equivalent**: GCC reorders `(x & 0xF) << 10` into
  `(x << 10) & 0x3C00`, which costs us one different 32-bit
  encoding even though the count and registers are the same.
  Behaviour is identical. Note: the exact identity of MMIO
  `0x40032430` isn't yet pinned to a named CC2642R1F register
  (it sits in the FLASH / VIMS controller band, `0x40030000..
  0x40034000`); the low 4 bits look like a hardware-revision /
  package code that downstream BIM logic consults to pick an
  application slot.
- **`exception.c`** — Three byte-identical 2-byte `b .` (Thumb
  `0xE7FE`) trap loops at `0x000568A6` / `0x00056C76` / `0x00056DA2`,
  routed from the HardFault, default, and NMI vector slots
  respectively. Compiled back to `e7fe` per handler with the project
  CFLAGS (`-Os -mthumb -mcpu=cortex-m4`); byte-equivalent.
- **Reset path identification (no module file yet)** — The
  Reset_Handler at `0x57126` is the stock TI driverlib `ResetISR`
  pattern, split across two physical entry points:
    * `0x57126` (10 B "stub"): `push {r3,lr}; bl SetupTrimDevice;
      b.w localProgramStart`. The 6 B at `0x57130..0x57135`
      (`bl HardFault_Handler; pop {r3,pc}`) are GCC's defensive
      epilogue — unreachable because `localProgramStart` is a
      tail-call to a `noreturn`-style function.
    * `0x56DD8` (52 B body, here named `ResetISR_body`): loads MSP
      from the literal pool (`0x20014000` — VT[0] / top of SRAM),
      enables the FPU (`SCB->CPACR |= 0xF00000`), runs two `nop`
      barriers, then chains into `.data` copy / `.bss` zero /
      `main` via the helpers at `0x571A0`, `0x56BF0`, `0x57000`,
      and `0x571A4`.
  Matches `source/ti/devices/cc13x2_cc26x2/startup_files/startup_gcc.c`
  in the SimpleLink CC13x2/CC26x2 SDK 3.40.00.02 (April 2020 — the
  TI release closest to bleboot's `Apr 23 2020` build date). No C
  source written yet — deferred until the `0x56DD8` body's helpers
  are decoded so we can either vendor TI's `startup_gcc.c` verbatim
  or hand-write a single `Reset_Handler` whose lowered code matches
  the OEM byte layout (the split entry is the GCC `-Os` artifact of
  compiling a single C-level `ResetISR` with a noreturn tail-call).

Status legend:

- **decomp-c** — translated to hand-written C in `src/`.
- **decomp-asm** — preserved as inline assembly because the cycle-
  exact sequence matters (DSB/ISB barriers, atomic compare-swap, etc.)
  and C lowers it differently.
- **vendor-stock** — recognised as a 1:1 copy of an upstream library
  function (TI Driver-lib, CMSIS, newlib). We link against the
  vendored upstream; we don't rewrite it.
- **named** — renamed in Ghidra but not yet translated.
- **pending** — still `FUN_xxxxxxxx`.

(The function table above is the single source of truth — the per-
bucket subsections that used to follow have been folded into it.)

## Upstream linkage

Both vendor-stock entries point at the TI SimpleLink CC13x2/CC26x2
SDK (release 3.40.00.02 brackets the OEM's `Apr 23 2020` build
date). The upstream is **linked from this doc, not vendored into
this repo** at this time; revisit once enough helpers are decoded
that vendoring saves more friction than it costs:

- `SetupTrimDevice` → `source/ti/devices/cc13x2_cc26x2/driverlib/setup.c`
- `_auto_init_table` → TI CGT compiler runtime (`<ccs_install>/tools/compiler/ti-cgt-arm_*/lib/src/_auto_init.c` or similar; not in the SimpleLink SDK itself but ships with the TI ARM Compiler).

Mirrors with browseable trees:
[`jeandudey/simplelink_cc13x2_26x2_sdk`](https://github.com/jeandudey/simplelink_cc13x2_26x2_sdk)
(SDK 3.40 — closest to the OEM build),
[`nanoframework/SimpleLink_CC13xx_26xx_SDK`](https://github.com/nanoframework/SimpleLink_CC13xx_26xx_SDK)
(SDK 5.40 — broader, later),
[`contiki-ng/cc26xxware`](https://github.com/contiki-ng/cc26xxware)
(older CC26x0 driverlib but same `SetupTrimDevice` semantics).

## Open questions

- The MMIO register at `0x40032430` that `main()` reads — sits in
  the `0x40030000..0x40034000` band between the FLASH controller
  and VIMS. Low 4 bits look like a hardware-revision / package
  code. Pin the exact register identity once we cross-reference
  the CC2642R1F TRM (or any TI sample that touches a similar
  address).
- `FUN_000560D8` (376 B) is the largest function in the image and
  lives near the top of `.text`. Likely the **BIM dispatcher**
  (the thing `FUN_00056F2A`, called by `main`, chains into via
  `bl 0x56254` + `bl 0x56824` + `bl 0x568A8`). Walk into it once
  the smaller helpers around the call path are recognised.
- The OAD image header bytes around file offset `0x1FA8` aren't
  yet parsed; the two `OAD NVM1` markers visible via `strings -t x`
  weren't auto-tagged by Ghidra because they sit inside a packed
  image-header struct that's not 4-byte aligned. A manual
  `DefineString` + struct overlay pass would surface the version /
  length / CRC fields cleanly.

## Decomp policy reminders

The bleboot image is small (≤ 7.9 KB executable), so the function
count is on the order of 30–80 — much smaller than mainware's
~800. Expect a high proportion of `vendor-stock` matches: TI's
Driver-lib `FlashProgram`, `FlashSectorErase`, `ChipInfo_*`, and the
`OAD_evalImageHeader`/`OAD_imgVerify` paths are all stock SDK code.

The custom logic should be confined to:

- the inter-MCU image-transfer wire path (Modbus framing from
  mainware, not TI's reference UART);
- the per-image acceptance policy (VanMoof's signing-key handling);
- the boot-decision state machine that picks among the image
  slot(s).

Translate the customised paths verbatim. Mark the Driver-lib calls
`vendor-stock` and link against TI's published source rather than
rewriting them.
